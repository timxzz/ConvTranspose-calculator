# ConvTranspose Calculator

Calculates output shape of convolutional transpose layers based on input shape, stride, kernel size, etc.

*Mainly based on [ConvNet Calculator](https://madebyollin.github.io/convnet-calculator/)* from [madebyollin](https://github.com/madebyollin) and the implementation of PyTorch's [nn.ConvTranspose2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d.html)
